## Tested Environments

Tested on

- EndeavourOS Linux x86_64 (Kernel: 6.13.8-arch1-1)
- Arch Linux x86_64 (Kernel: 6.13.8-arch1-1)

with Mozilla Firefox 136.0.2 browser

Ive used primarily the npm live-server 1.2.2 as a webserver, but also tested with the python http.server

You should be able to run the project out of the box by just starting an http server in the root directory

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
# or
live-server
```
